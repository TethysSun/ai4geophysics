3.3 Unsupervised Learning and Clustering Techniques 
================================================================

3.3.1 K-means Clustering 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
K-means is a type of clustering algorithm that divides a dataset into k groups, where k is a user-defined parameter. The algorithm works by finding the k points in the dataset that are closest to the center of each cluster, and then assigning each data point to its nearest cluster center.

3.3.2 Hierarchical Clustering 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.3 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction, which means reducing the number of input variables in a dataset. PCA works by identifying the directions in which the data varies the most and projecting the data onto these directions. The resulting dataset has fewer variables, but still captures most of the variation in the original dataset.

3.3.4 t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
