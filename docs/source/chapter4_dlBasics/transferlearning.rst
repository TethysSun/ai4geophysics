2.8 Transfer Learning
=================================

Transfer learning is a technique in machine learning that allows us to use knowledge gained while solving one problem to solve another related problem. In the context of neural networks, transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained neural networks to solve new problems. This technique is useful when we have limited labeled data for a new task or when we want to reduce the time and resources required to train a new model.

Transfer learning works by taking a pre-trained neural network and fine-tuning it for a new task. The pre-trained model has already learned useful features that can be transferred to the new task, so we only need to train the output layer of the network. This is known as transfer learning from the last layer. Alternatively, we can freeze some or all of the layers of the pre-trained network and train only the new layers added on top. This is known as transfer learning from multiple layers.

One popular pre-trained neural network for transfer learning is the ImageNet model, which has been trained on millions of images and has learned a rich set of features that can be transferred to many computer vision tasks. By leveraging pre-trained models like this, we can achieve state-of-the-art performance with much less labeled data than would be required to train a model from scratch.

In summary, transfer learning is a powerful technique that allows us to leverage pre-trained neural networks to solve new problems. By fine-tuning a pre-trained model, we can achieve state-of-the-art performance with less labeled data and reduced training time and resources.
