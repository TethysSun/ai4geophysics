2.3 Backpropagation
=================================

Backpropagation is the most commonly used algorithm for training neural networks. It is an iterative method for computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of the neural network. This gradient is used to adjust the weights and biases in order to minimize the loss function and improve the performance of the network.

The backpropagation algorithm works by first performing a forward pass through the network to compute the output for a given input. Then, it computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output of the network. This gradient is then propagated backwards through the network, layer by layer, using the chain rule of calculus.

More specifically, let L be the loss function, y be the output of the network, and w be the weights of the network. Then the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights is given by:

∂L/∂w = ∂L/∂y * ∂y/∂w

The first term on the right-hand side is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the output of the network, and the second term is the gradient of the output with respect to the weights.

The backpropagation algorithm computes these gradients layer by layer, starting from the output layer and working backwards towards the input layer. For each layer, the gradients are computed using the gradients of the layer above and the weights of the current layer.

Once the gradients have been computed, they are used to update the weights and biases of the network using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent. The weights and biases are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient, in order to move towards the minimum of the loss function.

Backpropagation is a powerful algorithm for training neural networks, and it has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains. However, it can be computationally expensive for large networks with many layers and neurons. There are several techniques for mitigating this, such as using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and regularization methods.

In summary, backpropagation is a key algorithm for training neural networks. It involves computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of the network, and using this gradient to adjust the weights and biases in order to minimize the loss function. The algorithm is computationally expensive for large networks, but there are techniques for mitigating this.
