2.7 Regularization
=================================

Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model that discourage it from fitting the noise in the training data. Some common regularization techniques used in neural networks include L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and dropout.

L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the absolute value of the weights. This encourages the model to learn sparse representations, where many of the weights are close to zero. This is useful when there are many input features and only a subset of them are relevant to the output.

L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the weights. This encourages the model to learn small weights, which can help prevent overfitting. L2 regularization is commonly used in neural networks.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons in the network during training. This encourages the network to learn more robust features that are not dependent on any one neuron. Dropout has been shown to be an effective regularization technique in neural networks.

In summary, regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting in neural networks by adding constraints to the model. L1 regularization encourages sparse representations, L2 regularization encourages small weights, and dropout encourages robust features. Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses and can be used depending on the specific problem being solved.
