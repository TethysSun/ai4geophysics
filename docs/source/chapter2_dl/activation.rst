2.4 Activations
=================================

Activation functions are an important component of neural networks. They introduce nonlinearity into the network and help to capture complex relationships between the inputs and outputs of the network. There are several types of activation functions, including the sigmoid function, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, and the softmax function.

The sigmoid function is a common activation function that maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1. It is given by the formula:

Ïƒ(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))

The sigmoid function is useful in binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes. It can be used as the activation function in the output layer of the network, where the output value represents the probability of the positive outcome.

The ReLU function is another popular activation function that is used in neural networks. It is given by the formula:

f(x) = max(0, x)

The ReLU function is simple and computationally efficient, and it has been shown to work well in many different types of neural networks. It is particularly useful in deep neural networks, where it can help to prevent the vanishing gradient problem that can occur with other activation functions.

The softmax function is a special activation function that is used in the output layer of neural networks for multiclass classification problems. It maps a vector of real-valued numbers to a vector of probabilities that add up to 1. The softmax function is given by the formula:

softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i) / sum(exp(x_j))

where x_i is the ith element of the input vector, and the sum is taken over all elements of the vector. The output of the softmax function can be interpreted as the probability of each class, and the class with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted class.

In summary, activation functions are an important component of neural networks. They introduce nonlinearity into the network and help to capture complex relationships between the inputs and outputs of the network. Some common activation functions include the sigmoid function, the ReLU function, and the softmax function, each with their own unique properties and use cases.
