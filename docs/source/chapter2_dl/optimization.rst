2.6 Optimization
=================================

Training a neural network involves finding the weights that minimize the loss function. Optimization algorithms are used to efficiently find the optimal set of weights by iteratively updating the weights based on the gradient of the loss function. Some common optimization algorithms used in neural networks include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm that updates the weights based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to a small subset of the training data, called a minibatch. The weights are updated iteratively for each minibatch until convergence. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size of each update and can have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm.

Adam is another optimization algorithm that is widely used in neural networks. It is an adaptive learning rate method that computes individual learning rates for different parameters based on the past gradients. It also incorporates momentum, which helps the optimizer to accelerate in the right direction and dampens oscillations.

Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each weight based on the historical gradients for that weight. It is well-suited for sparse data and has been shown to perform well on natural language processing tasks.

In summary, optimization algorithms are essential for training neural networks. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad are common optimization algorithms used to minimize the loss function by updating the weights of the network based on the gradient of the loss function. Each optimization algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses and can be used depending on the specific problem being solved.
