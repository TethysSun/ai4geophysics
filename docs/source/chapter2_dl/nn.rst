2.2 Neural Networks
=================================
Neural networks are the fundamental building blocks of deep learning. They are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain and are used to model and solve complex problems in a wide range of domains.

The basic structure of a neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes, called neurons. Each neuron receives input from the neurons in the previous layer and produces an output that is passed on to the neurons in the next layer. The connections between neurons are weighted, and each neuron applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs.

More formally, let x be the input to a neuron, and w be the weight vector of the connections between the neuron and its inputs. Then the output y of the neuron is given by y = f(w^T x + b), where f is the activation function, w^T is the transpose of the weight vector, and b is a bias term.

The output of a neural network is determined by the weights and biases of the neurons, which are learned during the training process. The training process involves adjusting the weights and biases to minimize a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the true output for a given input.

More formally, let X be the input data, y be the true output, and f_theta be the neural network with parameters theta (i.e., the weights and biases). Then the training process involves finding the optimal value of theta that minimizes the loss function L(theta; X, y). This is typically done using optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, which involve computing gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases.

There are several types of neural networks, each with its own structure and function. Some of the most common types include:

Feedforward neural networks: This is the simplest type of neural network, consisting of input, hidden, and output layers. The input layer receives the input data, and the output layer produces the predicted output. The hidden layers perform the computations required to transform the input into the output.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs): CNNs are commonly used in computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection. They consist of convolutional layers, which perform the operation of convolution on the input data, followed by pooling layers, which reduce the size of the feature maps produced by the convolutional layers.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): RNNs are used for processing sequential data, such as text or speech. They have a feedback loop that allows them to incorporate information from previous inputs into the current computation. This makes them well-suited for tasks such as language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation.

The mathematics of neural networks involves linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory. The computations involved in a neural network can be represented as matrix multiplications and nonlinear transformations, which are efficiently computed using parallel computing architectures. The weights and biases of the neurons are learned using optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, which involve computing gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases. The goal of the training process is to find the weights and biases that minimize the loss function and produce accurate predictions on new data.
