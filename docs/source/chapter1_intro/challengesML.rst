1.4 Challenges in Machine Learning
=========================================
There are several challenges in conventional machine learning algorithms:

    #. Limited ability to handle high-dimensional data: Many conventional machine learning algorithms struggle when working with high-dimensional data. High-dimensional data refers to datasets with a large number of features or attributes, which can lead to a large number of model parameters and require more time to train. This can result in overfitting or underfitting, where the model becomes too complex or too simple to generalize well to new data.

    #. Overfitting: Overfitting is a common challenge in machine learning where the model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to new data. This can occur when the model is too complex, or there is not enough training data to adequately represent the underlying patterns in the data.

    #. Underfitting: Underfitting is the opposite of overfitting, where the model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data. This results in poor performance on both the training and test data.

    #. Lack of interpretability: Many conventional machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and logistic regression, can be challenging to interpret, making it difficult to understand how the model makes its predictions. This can make it challenging to identify and correct errors or make informed decisions based on the model's predictions.

    #. Bias and fairness: Machine learning algorithms can be biased, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. This can occur when the training data is biased or when the algorithm's design itself introduces bias. It is important to ensure that machine learning algorithms are designed to be fair and unbiased, and that any biases in the training data are identified and addressed.

    #. Limited ability to handle sequential and time-series data: Many conventional machine learning algorithms assume that the data points are independent and identically distributed. This means that they are not well-suited to handle sequential and time-series data, where the order of the data points is important. To handle such data, specialized techniques such as recurrent neural networks or Hidden Markov Models are required.

    #. Limited ability to handle unstructured data: Many conventional machine learning algorithms are designed to work with structured data, such as numerical data or categorical data. They are not well-suited to handle unstructured data such as images, audio, and text. Specialized techniques such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks or natural language processing (NLP) techniques are required to handle such data.

In summary, conventional machine learning algorithms face several challenges when working with high-dimensional data, overfitting and underfitting, lack of interpretability, bias and fairness, sequential and time-series data, and unstructured data. However, by using specialized techniques and algorithms, some of these challenges can be mitigated.
