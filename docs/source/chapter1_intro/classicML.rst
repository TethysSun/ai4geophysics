1.3 Classical Machine Learning Algorithms
=========================================

Classical machine learning algorithms are the foundation of modern data analysis and have proven to be extremely effective in solving a wide range of problems. These algorithms use historical data to build models that can make predictions or classifications on new data. Among the most commonly used algorithms are linear regression, logistic regression, K-means, perceptrons, decision trees, random forests, native Bayes, Principal component analysis (PCA), support vector machines, and so on. each of these classical machine learning algorithms has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem being addressed, the type of data available, and the desired outcome.

1.3.1 Linear Regression
----------------------------------------
Linear regression is a popular algorithm used for predicting a numerical value based on a set of input variables. It works by finding the best linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable. The resulting model can be used to make predictions on new data.

1.3.2 Logistic Regression
----------------------------------------
Logistic regression is a popular algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It works by modeling the relationship between a set of input variables and a binary output variable. The output variable can take on only two values, typically represented as 0 and 1.

The algorithm works by calculating the probability of the output variable being 1 given the input variables. It does this by fitting a logistic function to the input variables. The logistic function maps the input variables to a probability value between 0 and 1.

Once the logistic function is fit to the data, the algorithm can make predictions on new data by calculating the probability of the output variable being 1 for each set of input variables. The algorithm then classifies the data as belonging to class 1 if the probability is above a certain threshold, and class 0 otherwise.

Logistic regression is a simple but powerful algorithm that is widely used in many applications, such as credit scoring, medical diagnosis, and marketing analytics. It has the advantage of being easy to interpret and can provide insights into the relationship between the input variables and the output variable.

1.3.3 K-means
----------------------------------------
K-means is a type of clustering algorithm that divides a dataset into k groups, where k is a user-defined parameter. The algorithm works by finding the k points in the dataset that are closest to the center of each cluster, and then assigning each data point to its nearest cluster center.


1.3.4 Perceptrons
----------------------------------------

Perceptrons are a type of neural network that consists of a single layer of nodes. They are particularly useful for classification tasks where the input data is linearly separable. Support vector machines (SVMs) are another popular algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs aim to find the best hyperplane that separates the data into two classes.

1.3.5 Decision Trees
----------------------------------------

Decision trees are a type of algorithm that builds a tree-like structure to classify data based on a set of conditions. Each internal node of the tree represents a condition, and each leaf node represents a class label. Logistic regression is a type of algorithm used for classification, where the output is a probability of an event occurring. It is particularly useful when working with binary data.


1.3.6 Random Forests
----------------------------------------
Random forests are a type of ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of predictions. The algorithm randomly selects a subset of the input variables and a subset of the training data to build each tree. The predictions of the individual trees are then combined to make a final prediction.



1.3.7 Native Bayes
----------------------------------------
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm that is commonly used for classification tasks. It works by calculating the probability of each class given a set of input variables. The algorithm assumes that the input variables are independent of each other, which is why it is called "naive." Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes can perform well on many types of classification problems.

1.3.8 Principal Component Analysis
----------------------------------------
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction, which means reducing the number of input variables in a dataset. PCA works by identifying the directions in which the data varies the most and projecting the data onto these directions. The resulting dataset has fewer variables, but still captures most of the variation in the original dataset.


1.3.9 Support Vector Machine
----------------------------------------

Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The algorithm works by finding the best hyperplane that separates the data into two classes.

In binary classification tasks, the goal of the SVM is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. By maximizing the margin, the SVM can find a hyperplane that is most likely to generalize well to new data.

In cases where the data is not linearly separable, the SVM uses a technique called the kernel trick to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes separable by a hyperplane. The kernel trick allows the SVM to handle non-linear decision boundaries.

SVMs have several advantages over other classification algorithms. They can handle high-dimensional data and are relatively robust to overfitting. They can also handle large datasets efficiently using a technique called the kernel trick.

SVMs have many applications, including image recognition, text classification, and bioinformatics. The choice of kernel function and other hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the SVM, and careful tuning is often required to obtain optimal results.
